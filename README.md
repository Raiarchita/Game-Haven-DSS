The video game store "Game Haven" is an international brand of video game stores
looking to improve their inventory management system to increase profitability and 
customer satisfaction. Currently, the store struggles with identifying which games to 
purchase, limited understanding of their customers' preferences, which hinders their 
ability to offer personalized recommendations and promotions. This leads to 
overstocking certain games and understocking others, causing missed sales 
opportunities and frustrated customers. 
The goal of this project is to develop a Decision Support System (DSS) that can help 
Game Haven optimize their inventory management processes by analysing sales 
data, customer preferences, and industry trends. The DSS should be able to provide 
recommendations on which games to purchase, how many copies to stock, and when 
to restock based on predictive analytics. It should also be able to identify patterns and 
trends in customer behaviour, allowing the store to offer personalized 
recommendations and promotions to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Overall, the DSS should enable Game Haven to make data-driven decisions that 
improve their inventory management processes, increase profitability, and enhance 
the customer experience.
